///To get all the softwares and things needed to use this library blocks
You can download the IRobot Create 2 mathlab toolbox from online. This Toolbox has all the functions you will need for interfacing with IRoomba.

This is the link to download the matlab toolbox- https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52644-matlab-toolbox-for-the-irobot-create-2

Download wifi scanner 3.4 from the internet Below is the link http://www.softpedia.com/get/Network-Tools/Network-Monitoring/Wi-Fi-Scanner.shtml

In order to use this library you would have to have your laptop connected to your IRoomba using an Edimax nano wifi chip adapter and a WiFi to serial for the serial port on the Roomba. Below is the link for the edimax nano usb and roomba wifi-card

Connect to your Roomba using Wi-fi scanner .Right click on the wifi name and click connect. You will know it is connected when the device youre trying to connect to is in bold font.


# project2


Open the "project2lib" file to get the library blocks
From there copy all The blocks to a blank model space
Connect the wifi block as an input to the   and Temperature block and 
the Ir Block and also to the main block. Connect the temp to the main block and the ir to the main block
Run the simulation. This should move the roomba and when there is an object in front of the ir sensors it will turn 
and if all the ir sensors are blocked it will move backwards. This will also monitor the temperature of the Roomba .
